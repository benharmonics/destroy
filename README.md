# shred

*shred* takes a file and replaces its contents with random bytes. You can also
delete the file after shredding it with the `-d` flag.

## Usage

```bash
shred [OPTIONS] <FILE> ...
```

## Installation

You'll need Cargo, but you already have that, right? So just run the command:

```bash
cargo install --path /path/to/shred
```
